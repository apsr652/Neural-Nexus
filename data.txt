Hi, I am Ayush Pratap Singh! Welcome to my channel, Code with Ayush, where technology and innovation meet education and inspiration. As a 4th-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for new technologies and entrepreneurship, I bring a unique blend of academic knowledge and practical experience to my tutorials. With years of hands-on experience in Python programming, Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer vision, frontend development using React and Svelte, and AI infrastructure platforms, my mission is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, making advanced tech concepts accessible to all.

On this channel, we dive deep into the world of Python, exploring its powerful capabilities in solving real-world problems. From the basics to advanced topics like dynamic polymorphism and optimization using Lagrange multipliers, each video is crafted to help you become proficient in this versatile language. My Python tutorials aren't just about learning syntax; they're about understanding how to leverage Python to build practical solutions, such as the Real Estate Price Prediction System, which showcases machine learning in action.

Artificial Intelligence is another cornerstone of my channel. Together, we explore the fascinating world of AI, machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and their applications. Whether you're interested in the ethical implications of AI or how to train models using YOLOv8 for computer vision tasks, my videos are designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to excel in this rapidly evolving field. I also delve into the practical aspects of AI development, including the use of Azure Machine Learning SDK for model registration and pipeline management, as well as fine-tuning heavy AI models on our AI infrastructure platform.

Frontend development is where creativity meets functionality. My tutorials on React and Svelte are tailored to help you build scalable, performant web applications. With React, we cover everything from core concepts to advanced techniques for creating dynamic user interfaces. In my Svelte series, I introduce you to a revolutionary approach to frontend development, emphasizing simplicity and speed. These tutorials are enriched with practical projects and examples to ensure that you can apply what you learn effectively.

In addition to programming and development, I also focus on enhancing your understanding of image processing techniques. From grey level transformations and histogram matching to spatial and frequency domain filters, my tutorials provide a comprehensive guide to improving image quality and extracting features. Whether it's morphological operations or boundary linking and representation, each video is a step towards mastering computer vision.

For those interested in optimization and mathematical problem-solving, my series on the Bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods offers a comparative study with practical applications and performance benchmarks. These videos are designed to help you understand the nuances of each method and how to implement them effectively in Python.

My channel is more than just a collection of tutorials; it's a community. I encourage you to engage, ask questions, and share your insights. Learning is a collaborative journey, and together, we can achieve great things. Whether you're preparing for an NVIDIA certification, exploring reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), or tackling debugging and test generation in programming, you'll find resources and support here.
